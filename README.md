# Algorithm Practice - Introduction to Algorithms, 4th Edition

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is a personal project to track my progress and solutions as I work through the problems in the 4th edition of "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The intent is to improve my algorithmic thinking and coding skills by actively engaging with the material.

## Progress
I will be updating this repository with my solutions as I complete them.

## My Approach
For each problem, I aim to:
- Understand the problem statement and underlying concepts.
- Develop a step-by-step algorithmic solution.
- Translate the algorithm into code.
- Test the code with various inputs for correctness and efficiency.

## Usage of Solutions
While these solutions are open for others to view, I encourage everyone to first attempt solving the problems independently to maximize the learning experience.

## Disclaimer
The solutions provided are my own and they are not official solutions from the book authors. This repository is for educational purposes only.

## Feedback
If you have suggestions on how I can improve my solutions or alternative approaches to the problems, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I appreciate collaborative learning and constructive feedback.

Happy Solving!
