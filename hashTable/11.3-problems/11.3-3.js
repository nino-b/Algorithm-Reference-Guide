/** 
 * # Problem
 * Consider a version of the division method in which h(k) = k mod m, where m = 2^p âˆ’ 1 and k is a character string interpreted in radix 2^p. 
 * Show that if string x can be converted to string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to the same value. 
 * Give an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function.
