/** 
 * # Problem
 * Consider a version of the division method in which h(k) = k mod m, where m = 2^p âˆ’ 1 and k is a character string interpreted in radix 2^p. 
 * Show that if string x can be converted to string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to the same value. 
 * Give an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function.
 * 
 * This type of behavior is undesirable if all keys are permutations of each other.
 * In this case every element will hash to the same place, and we won't be able to profit with dirrect-address nature of the Hash Table. 
 * Instead, we will have to linearly search through collided elements.
 * Thus this will cause the worst case scenario of search time (O(n) where n is number of elements in the table).
