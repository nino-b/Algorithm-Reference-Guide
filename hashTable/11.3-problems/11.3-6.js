/** 
 * # Problem
 * Let U be the set of d-tuples of values drawn from Z_p, and let Q = Z_p, where p is prime. Define the hash function h_b : U → Q for b ∈ Z_p on an input d-tuple ⟨a_0, a_1, ..., a_(d−1)⟩ from U as

h_b(⟨a_0, a_1, ..., a_(d−1)⟩) = (∑_(j=0)^(d−1) a_j b^j) mod p, and let ℋ = {h_b : b ∈ Z_p}. Argue that ℋ is ε-universal for ε = (d − 1)/p. (Hint: See Exercise 31.4-4.)
