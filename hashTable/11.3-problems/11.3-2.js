/** 
 * # Problem
 * You hash a string of r characters into m slots by treating it as a radix-128 number and then using the division method. 
 * You can represent the number m as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as a radix-128 number, takes many words. 
 * How can you apply the division method to compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant number of words 
 * of storage outside the string itself?
